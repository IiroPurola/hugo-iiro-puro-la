## Broad-ranging Experience in IT and Marketing

Throughout my career, I've held various roles that have allowed me to develop a diverse skill set.

As an IT specialist, I've provided local support and managed both local and virtual servers. I've developed proficiency in Azure AD, Azure VMs, Azure Blob Storage, and Microsoft 365 administration. I've also gained experience in frontend web development, focusing on enhancing client environments.

Beyond technical roles, I've engaged in project management, where I oversaw the entire lifecycle of various IT hardware, from sales to disposal. Additionally, I've been entrusted with providing training to both enterprise employees and educational institutions, a testament to my deep understanding of IT systems and processes.

In the realm of marketing, I've contributed to graphic development for product advancement, taken on graphic design for clients, and handled photography for different projects. I've initiated and implemented web page projects, primarily on WordPress, and maintained the company's website.

Earlier in my career, I dabbled in administrative roles which involved handling invoices, processing orders, and managing office tasks. These experiences have honed my organizational skills and given me a solid understanding of business processes.

I've also held a unique role as a media assistant, where I was responsible for planning and executing tests for various projects. In this capacity, I gained experience in graphic design, web page projects, and managing a CentOS Linux LAMP + CPanel web server.

This diverse range of roles has provided me with a well-rounded skill set, equipping me to tackle the challenges and seize the opportunities in the evolving field of Azure Cloud Operations.
