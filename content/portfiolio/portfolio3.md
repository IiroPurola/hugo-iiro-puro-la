## Overview:

The client requested a design and implementation of Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) environments that cater to three distinct user groups in their organization. The project involved the creation of three separate workloads: a custom customer service desktop, and two versions of the Jump environment, each serving unique user requirements and access privileges.

## Challenge:

The project presented a multifaceted challenge. The client required a custom customer service desktop equipped with specific software, and two versions of Jump environments â€“ one displaying selected portals via a browser, and another solely designed for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) associations. Each of these had to cater to different user groups, while maintaining high levels of operational efficiency and security.

## Solutions:

To address the diverse needs of the client's user groups, we devised three distinct AVD environments:

1. For the customer service team, we created a custom AVD desktop, integrating all necessary software they required for efficient operations. This highly personalized setup ensured the team had the exact tools they needed, enhancing productivity and user experience.

2. For users requiring access to specific portals via a web browser, we configured a Jump environment tailored to this need. It was optimized for user-friendly access and operational efficiency.

3. For users needing secure and direct server access via RDP associations, we designed a separate Jump environment.

For all these setups, stringent security protocols were put in place to prevent unauthorized access and ensure system integrity.

## Results:

The successful implementation of these three unique AVD workloads led to improved efficiency across the different user groups. The tailored solutions catered to the client's unique needs, offering a level of customization that greatly improved the overall user experience. The flexibility of using both custom and Azure gallery images for different setups showcased our ability to adapt to a wide range of requirements and scenarios.
