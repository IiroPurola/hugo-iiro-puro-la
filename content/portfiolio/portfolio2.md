## Overview:

The project involved the creation of two distinct websites for a transport company. The first website, aimed at customers, would provide information about the company's services, while the second, an intranet site, would serve as a secure platform for entrepreneurs in the transport industry to access exclusive content. The project was independently planned and implemented using WordPress and hosted on a Finnish service provider.

## Challenge:

The client needed both websites to be fast, user-friendly, visually appealing, and easily editable. In addition, the intranet site needed to be secure, ensuring access only to authorized users in the transport industry.

## Solutions:

1. A robust structure was developed for the customer website, which included a homepage, product pages, contact information, and ways to connect with the company. This structure ensured the information was easily accessible and understandable to users.

2. WordPress, known for its flexibility and user-friendly interface, was chosen as the technology for website development. This allowed for easy editing and maintenance of both sites.

3. The intranet site was designed with secure user authentication. This ensured that content meant solely for entrepreneurs in the transport industry could be protected and accessed only by authorized individuals.

4. Both sites were hosted on a Finnish hosting provider, ensuring reliable performance and quick loading speeds.

## Results:

The resulting websites successfully catered to their respective audiences. The customer-facing website was well-structured and user-friendly, effectively showcasing the company's offerings, while the intranet site served as a secure hub of information for entrepreneurs in the transport industry. The client was satisfied with the speed, design, and ease of use of both websites.
