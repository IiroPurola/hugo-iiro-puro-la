The first website, aimed at customers, would provide information about the company&amp;rsquo;s services, while the second, an intranet site, would serve as a secure platform for entrepreneurs in the transport industry to access exclusive content. The project was independently planned and implemented using WordPress and hosted on a Finnish service provider.
Challenge: The client needed both websites to be fast, user-friendly, visually appealing, and easily editable.</description></item></channel></rss>
