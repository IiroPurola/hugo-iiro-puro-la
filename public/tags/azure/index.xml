&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The client requested a design and implementation of Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) environments that cater to three distinct user groups in their organization. The project involved the creation of three separate workloads: a custom customer service desktop, and two versions of the Jump environment, each serving unique user requirements and access privileges.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="challenge">Challenge:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The project presented a multifaceted challenge. The client required a custom customer service desktop equipped with specific software, and two versions of Jump environments â€“ one displaying selected portals via a browser, and another solely designed for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) associations. Each of these had to cater to different user groups, while maintaining high levels of operational efficiency and security.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Transition to Serverless IT Infrastructure with Azure AD and Intune</title><link>https://iiro.puro.la/portfiolio/transition-to-serverless-it-infrastructure-with-azure-ad-and-intune/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>email@example.com (Iiro Purola)</author><guid>https://iiro.puro.la/portfiolio/transition-to-serverless-it-infrastructure-with-azure-ad-and-intune/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://iiro.puro.la/portfiolio/img/portfolio_serverles_it_infra.webp" alt="Website">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This project revolved around modernizing a company&amp;rsquo;s IT infrastructure by migrating it to a serverless model. The endeavor involved replacing the traditional on-premises Active Directory with Azure Active Directory and introducing Microsoft Intune for robust device management. The project also encompassed a shift from the conventional print server to Printix, along with strengthening the security and backup system of the Microsoft cloud environment and emails.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="challenge">Challenge:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The company previously lacked a comprehensive device management system and had an outdated on-premises Active Directory. The challenge was to transition the entire IT infrastructure to a more scalable and modern framework without compromising security or user experience.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
