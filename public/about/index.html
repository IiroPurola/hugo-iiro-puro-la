<h2 id="broad-ranging-experience-in-it-and-marketing">Broad-ranging Experience in IT and Marketing</h2>
<p>Throughout my career, I&rsquo;ve held various roles that have allowed me to develop a diverse skill set.</p>
<p>As an IT specialist, I&rsquo;ve provided local support and managed both local and virtual servers. I&rsquo;ve developed proficiency in Azure AD, Azure VMs, Azure Blob Storage, and Microsoft 365 administration. I&rsquo;ve also gained experience in frontend web development, focusing on enhancing client environments.</p>
<p>Beyond technical roles, I&rsquo;ve engaged in project management, where I oversaw the entire lifecycle of various IT hardware, from sales to disposal. Additionally, I&rsquo;ve been entrusted with providing training to both enterprise employees and educational institutions, a testament to my deep understanding of IT systems and processes.</p>
<p>In the realm of marketing, I&rsquo;ve contributed to graphic development for product advancement, taken on graphic design for clients, and handled photography for different projects. I&rsquo;ve initiated and implemented web page projects, primarily on WordPress, and maintained the company&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>Earlier in my career, I dabbled in administrative roles which involved handling invoices, processing orders, and managing office tasks. These experiences have honed my organizational skills and given me a solid understanding of business processes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also held a unique role as a media assistant, where I was responsible for planning and executing tests for various projects. In this capacity, I gained experience in graphic design, web page projects, and managing a CentOS Linux LAMP + CPanel web server.</p>
<p>This diverse range of roles has provided me with a well-rounded skill set, equipping me to tackle the challenges and seize the opportunities in the evolving field of Azure Cloud Operations.</p>
