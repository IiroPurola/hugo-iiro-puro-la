<h2 id="overview">Overview:</h2>
<p>The project involved the creation of two distinct websites for a transport company. The first website, aimed at customers, would provide information about the company&rsquo;s services, while the second, an intranet site, would serve as a secure platform for entrepreneurs in the transport industry to access exclusive content. The project was independently planned and implemented using WordPress and hosted on a Finnish service provider.</p>
<h2 id="challenge">Challenge:</h2>
<p>The client needed both websites to be fast, user-friendly, visually appealing, and easily editable. In addition, the intranet site needed to be secure, ensuring access only to authorized users in the transport industry.</p>
<h2 id="solutions">Solutions:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A robust structure was developed for the customer website, which included a homepage, product pages, contact information, and ways to connect with the company. This structure ensured the information was easily accessible and understandable to users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WordPress, known for its flexibility and user-friendly interface, was chosen as the technology for website development. This allowed for easy editing and maintenance of both sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The intranet site was designed with secure user authentication. This ensured that content meant solely for entrepreneurs in the transport industry could be protected and accessed only by authorized individuals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both sites were hosted on a Finnish hosting provider, ensuring reliable performance and quick loading speeds.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="results">Results:</h2>
<p>The resulting websites successfully catered to their respective audiences. The customer-facing website was well-structured and user-friendly, effectively showcasing the company&rsquo;s offerings, while the intranet site served as a secure hub of information for entrepreneurs in the transport industry. The client was satisfied with the speed, design, and ease of use of both websites.</p>
