<h2 id="overview">Overview:</h2>
<p>This project revolved around modernizing a company&rsquo;s IT infrastructure by migrating it to a serverless model. The endeavor involved replacing the traditional on-premises Active Directory with Azure Active Directory and introducing Microsoft Intune for robust device management. The project also encompassed a shift from the conventional print server to Printix, along with strengthening the security and backup system of the Microsoft cloud environment and emails.</p>
<h2 id="challenge">Challenge:</h2>
<p>The company previously lacked a comprehensive device management system and had an outdated on-premises Active Directory. The challenge was to transition the entire IT infrastructure to a more scalable and modern framework without compromising security or user experience.</p>
<h2 id="solutions">Solutions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Azure Active Directory: The legacy on-premises Active Directory was replaced with Azure AD, providing a scalable and cloud-based identity solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Microsoft Intune: For the first time, a robust device management system was introduced using Microsoft Intune. This allowed for better control and security over company devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Printix: We replaced the traditional print server with Printix, facilitating seamless printing services across the company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security &amp; Backup: We enhanced the security of the Microsoft cloud environment and company emails, and ensured a comprehensive backup strategy was in place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seamless Integration: All company devices were integrated with Azure AD and Intune, enabling smooth software deployment, including Printix clients and remote support applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VPN-free Operations: The newly designed environment allowed employees to work securely from any location without the need for a VPN connection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="results">Results:</h2>
<p>The transition to a serverless IT infrastructure using Azure AD, Intune, and Printix was successful, resulting in enhanced scalability, control, and security. The client now benefits from a modern, robust IT framework that supports safe, VPN-free operations from any location. This project significantly contributes to flexible work models, setting the company for future growth and adaptability.</p>
